# Application's configuration file (HOCON format)

# You can include other configuration files in this main application.conf file:

#
# You can declare variables and substitute for them:
#mykey = \${some.value}
#
# And if an environment variable exists when there is no other subsitution, then
# HOCON will fall back to substituting environment variable:
#mykey = \${JAVA_HOME}
